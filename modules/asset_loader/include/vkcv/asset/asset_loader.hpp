/* LOADING MESHES
 * The description of meshes is a hierarchy of structures with the Mesh at the
 * top.
 *
 * Each Mesh has an array of one or more vertex groups (called "primitives" in
 * glTF parlance). Specifically, it has an array of indices into an array of
 * vertex groups defined by the Scene struct.
 *
 * Each vertex group describes a part of the meshes vertices by defining how
 * they should be rendered (as points, lines, triangles), how many indices and
 * vertices there are, how the content of the vertex buffer is to be
 * interpreted and which material from the Scenes materials array should be
 * used for the surface of the vertices.
 * As a bonus there is also the axis aligned bounding box of the vertices.
 *
 * The vertex buffer is presented as a single block of binary data with a given
 * length in bytes.
 * The layout of the vertex buffer is described by an array of VertexAttribute
 * structs that define the type of attribute, the offset, length and stride in
 * bytes and number and type of components of the attribute.
 * These values can directly be given to vulkan when describing the content of
 * vertex buffers. */
