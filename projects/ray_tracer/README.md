# Ray tracer
An example project to show the implementation of a ray tracer with the VkCV framework

## Details

The project shows off an example implementation of a ray tracer using compute shaders to render
an image containing abstract geometry and materials with different properties. The ray tracer 
limits the maximal depth to allow highly detailed reflections without getting too slow for 
realtime use.
