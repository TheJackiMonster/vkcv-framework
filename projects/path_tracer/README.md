# Path tracer
An example project to show the implementation of a path tracer with the VkCV framework

## Details

The project shows off an example implementation of a path tracer using compute shaders to render 
a physically plausible image given an artificial subset of materials. The path tracer uses a 
converging technique to reduce the noise of the image iteratively.
