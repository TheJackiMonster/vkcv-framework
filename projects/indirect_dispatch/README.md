# Indirect dispatch
An example project to show usage of indirect compute shader dispatching

## Details

The project shows off indirect dispatching of compute shaders for an implementation of motion 
blur. Additionally, the calculated motion vectors for the motion blur can be used for temporal 
upscaling techniques such as FSR2.
