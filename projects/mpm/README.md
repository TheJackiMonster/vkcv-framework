## Details

The project shows off an example implementation of an MPM simulation which are widely used
in computer graphics to simulate the behavior of solids, liquids or gases. It utilizes the discrete
representation of objects as combined particles as well as a discrete grid of data. Together both 
representations help to stabilize the result while providing as much detail as possible.
