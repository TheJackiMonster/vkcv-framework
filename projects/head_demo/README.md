## Details

This project renders a mesh from a human skull by [HannahNewey](https://sketchfab.com/HannahNewey)
and splits the rendering on three axes into diffusive shading and drawing the vertices as point 
cloud. In a similar way you could visualize different layers of a human body to make a specific 
part the visual focus without blending the layers above completely away.
